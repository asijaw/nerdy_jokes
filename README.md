# NerdyJokes

This is a CLI app built in Ruby as a portfolio project for the Flatiron School Software Engineering curriculum.

The app utilizes the Reader's Digest Jokes website (www.rd.com/jokes). On start up the app will scrape the Reader's Digest website for some of the nerdiest jokes.

Once finished scraping the user will be asked to choose a jokes category.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'nerdy_jokes'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install nerdy_jokes

## Navigating

You will be ask if you want to see the joke categories and then will be promoted with 4 categories of jokes: Math, Science, Computer, or Dad Jokes

Choose a category category and press `ENTER`

Choose a joke by number to see and hit `ENTER`

Type `exit` at any time to exit
